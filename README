deploy-tools
============

Assorted deployment tools that I'm using.
Description follows.

* ccrb-build-status

  Can be used to get the list of most recent builds
  from a CC.rb (http://cruisecontrolrb.thoughtworks.com/)
  installation for a given project.

  Useful because then you can either grep for a given revision,
  or get the latest 3/5/n, etc... Example:

  # Get latest revision
  ccrb-build-status \
      --server http://my.dev.server/ccrb \
      --project myproj | head -1

  # Get most recent failed revision
  ccrb-build-status \
      --server http://my.dev.server/ccrb \
      --project myproj | grep failed | head -1


* deployer

  An IRC bot that uses Bot::BasicBot and Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable
  It will detect new builds for your projects, and answer queries
  about builds and projects.

  Send "help deployer" to the bot to know more about it.

  "deployer" is the script to be run

  "Deployer.pm" is the Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable module

  "deployer.conf" is the configuration file that contains info about
     your projects, source code repositories and continuous integration servers.

* hudson-build-status

  Mostly the same as ccrb-build-status, just for Hudson
  (https://hudson.dev.java.net)

* vcs-latest-revision

  Gets you the latest revision from a *remote* svn or git
  repository. If you know a nice way to do this with git
  that doesn't involve cloning, let me know... :)

  Examples:

    vcs-latest-revision http://my.dev.server/svn/myproject/trunk
    vcs-latest-revision user@my.git.server:/var/lib/git/myproject.git
